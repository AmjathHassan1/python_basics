Module1 : End Project

As a culminating project, you'll be working with a dataset from ABC company,
consisting of 458 rows and 9 columns. The company requires a comprehensive
report detailing information about their employees across various teams. Your
tasks include preprocessing the dataset, analyzing the data, and presenting your
findings graphically. Here's a breakdown of what you need to do:
Preprocessing:

● Correct the data in the "height" column by replacing it with random
numbers between 150 and 180. Ensure data consistency and integrity
before proceeding with analysis. (1 mark)

Analysis Tasks:
● Determine the distribution of employees across each team and calculate
the percentage split relative to the total number of employees. (2 marks)
● Segregate employees based on their positions within the company. (2
marks)
● Identify the predominant age group among employees. (2 marks)
● Discover which team and position have the highest salary expenditure. (2
marks)
● Investigate if there's any correlation between age and salary, and
represent it visually. (2 marks)
Graphical Representation:
● For each of the five analysis tasks above, create appropriate visualizations
to present your findings effectively. (5x2 = 10 marks)
● Data Story: Provide insights gained from the analysis, highlighting key
trends, patterns, and correlations within the dataset. (3 marks)
● Timely Submission: Ensure timely submission of your project to earn an
additional mark. (1 mark)
Total Marks : 25
By completing these tasks, you'll not only demonstrate your proficiency in Python
programming but also your ability to analyze and communicate insights from

real-world data. Download the dataset from this link. (Please find the

● To submit the project:
● Create a repository on your GitHub account.
● Write a comprehensive overview of the project in the README file,
summarizing the preprocessing steps, analysis tasks, graphical
representations, insights gained, and any additional information.
● Upload a well-organized Jupyter Notebook file containing the code for the
project, ensuring proper formatting and documentation.
● Include the dataset in the repository.
● Submit the link to your repository in the designated section on the app.
