# Visualization with Seaborn and Matplotlib
# Use the “Titanic” dataset from Seaborn and do the following:
#
# Countplot: Passenger Count by Embarked Port
# ● Create a countplot to display the number of passengers who boarded from each port (embarked), separated by sex.



# Swarmplot: Age Distribution across Classes
# ● Create a swarmplot to visualize the distribution of age across passenger classes (pclass), categorized by sex.



# Pie Chart: Gender Distribution
# ● Create a pie chart using Matplotlib to show the percentage of male vs. female passengers. - Add percentage labels using autopct - Use explode for one slice to highlight it.



# Heatmap: Correlation Matrix
# ● Create a heatmap to show correlations between age, fare, pclass, sibsp, parch, and survived. (Use seaborn.heatmap with annotations)



# Violin Plot: Fare by Class and Gender
# ● Create a violin plot to visualize fare distribution across classes, separated by gender.



# Scatter Plot: Age vs Fare
# ● Create a scatter plot to explore the relationship between age and fare, colored by survival status.
# ● Use a seaborn scatterplot with hue='survived'. Each plot must have titles, labels, and legends where needed.



# Write short observations under each plot explaining insights.
