This project focuses on performing a detailed analysis of an employee dataset to uncover meaningful insights related to
team structure, workforce demographics, salary distribution, and key organizational patterns. Through data cleaning,
grouping, visualization, and statistical evaluation, the project provides a clear understanding of how employees
are distributed across teams, positions, and age groups.

The analysis includes calculating team-wise employee counts and percentage splits, identifying how positions
are distributed within each team, and determining the most common age group in the organization. Salary expenditure
is examined both at the team and position level to highlight where the company invests most in compensation.
A correlation study is also conducted to explore the relationship between age and salary, supported by visual representation.

Overall, this project helps in understanding workforce composition, identifying structural patterns,
and supporting better decision-making through data-driven insights.
